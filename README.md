# Lavender
Lavender Engine is a game engine to make not only games, but a lot more.  
It's right now in the making process and it is not really ready to use!  
Lavender Engine only supports Windows platform but we are willing to make it supported by all platforms soon!
# Installation
To setup and run the project:
1. Clone the repository recursively using the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/m96fa-1/Lavender.git
```
2. Open the `scripts` folder and run the `SetupProjects.bat` file and the Visual Studio solution and projects will be automatically generated.
3. Open the solution in the cloned directory and hit `F5` on keyboard to run The Windows Debugger.
